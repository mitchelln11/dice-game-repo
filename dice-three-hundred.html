            <h1>Dice Cricket</h1>
            <p>The goal of this game is to "close out" the numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and bullseye.
            You can accomplish this by hitting these numbers three times.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Close out the numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and bullseye(25).</li>
                <li>If one player has already closed out a number, they will get points in the amount they roll, as long as the opposing player has NOT closed out the same number.</li>
                <li>The first player to close out all numbers AND have the highest score wins.</li>
                <li>If a value other than 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or bullseye(25) is rolled, no points will be given, and no numbers will close out. They are considered misses.</li>
